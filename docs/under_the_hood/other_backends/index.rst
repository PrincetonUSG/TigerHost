Other PaaS Projects
===================
In addition to Deis, we also looked at a couple other candidates for backends. A major requirement is that the projects must have a Heroku-like git-deploy interface, which all the projects listed on this page do. Coincidentally, all of these projects are also Docker-based, which may be due to the rise in popularity of Heroku coinciding with the adoption of Docker.
