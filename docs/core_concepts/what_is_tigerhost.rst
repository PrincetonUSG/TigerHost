What is TigerHost?
====================

TigerHost is Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution based on git. Each git repository corresponds to one "app", and each app is available at <app_name>.tigerhostapp.com.

TigerHost is designed to be compatible with `Heroku <http://heroku.com/>`_ and should serve as more or less a drop-in replacement. In fact, the original motivation for TigerHost is to offer Princeton students the convenience of the popular commercial service at no cost.

This section of documentation will be aimed at people who are not already using Heroku. If you are, you may want to skip this section.
